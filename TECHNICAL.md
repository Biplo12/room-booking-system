# Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

System Components:

- RESTful API (Flask),
- SPA Frontend (Next.js),
- PostgreSQL Database,
- JWT Authentication,
- Redis Cache (optional)

## Backend Architecture

Core Modules:

- Authentication & Authorization,
- Room Management,
- Booking System,
- Analytics Engine,
- Error Handling

API Structure:

- /api/v1/auth/\* (authentication endpoints),
- /api/v1/rooms/\* (room management),
- /api/v1/bookings/\* (reservation system),
- /api/v1/users/\* (user management),
- /api/v1/analytics/\* (statistics and reports)

Database Models:

1. User:

   - id: Integer (PK),
   - username: String (unique),
   - password: String (hashed),
   - role: String (admin/user),
   - created_at: DateTime

2. ConferenceRoom:

   - id: Integer (PK),
   - name: String,
   - capacity: Integer,
   - location: String,
   - equipment: String,
   - image_url: String,
   - is_deleted: Boolean

3. Reservation:
   - id: Integer (PK),
   - room_id: Integer (FK),
   - user_id: Integer (FK),
   - start_time: DateTime,
   - end_time: DateTime,
   - title: String,
   - description: Text,
   - is_deleted: Boolean

## Frontend Architecture

Component Structure:

- Layout Components,
- Authentication Components,
- Room Management Components,
- Booking Components,
- Analytics Components,
- Shared UI Components

State Management:

1. User Store:

   - Authentication state,
   - User preferences,
   - Permissions

2. Booking Store:
   - Room listings,
   - Reservations,
   - Selected room data,
   - Booking status

Key Features:

1. Room Management:

   - Room creation/editing,
   - Image upload,
   - Equipment management,
   - Availability tracking

2. Booking System:

   - Date/time selection,
   - Conflict checking,
   - Confirmation flow,
   - Cancellation handling

3. Analytics Dashboard:
   - Usage statistics,
   - Trend visualization,
   - Export functionality,
   - Custom reporting

## Security Implementation

Authentication:

- JWT token handling,
- Password hashing,
- Role-based access,
- Session management

Data Protection:

- Input validation,
- XSS prevention,
- CSRF protection,
- Rate limiting

Error Handling:

- Global error boundary,
- API error interceptors,
- Logging system,
- User notifications

## Performance Optimizations

Backend:

- Query optimization,
- Connection pooling,
- Response caching,
- Background tasks

Frontend:

- Code splitting,
- Image optimization,
- State management,
- API request batching

## Testing Strategy
